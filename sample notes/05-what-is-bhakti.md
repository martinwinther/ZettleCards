What is Bhakti Yoga?

Bhakti Yoga is the path of loving devotion to the Supreme. Krishna declares it the highest and most accessible path to liberation.

"Always think of Me, become My devotee, worship Me, and offer your homage unto Me. Thus you will come to Me without fail."

Key practices include:
- Constant remembrance of the Divine
- Surrender of the ego and personal will
- Service and worship with love
- Seeing the Divine in all beings

Unlike jnana (knowledge) or karma (action), bhakti requires no special qualificationsâ€”only sincere love and devotion.
