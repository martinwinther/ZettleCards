Krishna makes a profound distinction between the field (kshetra) and the knower of the field (kshetrajna).

**The Field**: The body, senses, mind, elements, ego—everything material and changing.

**The Knower**: The conscious witness, the atman, the unchanging awareness that perceives the field.

Most people identify with the field, mistaking the body and mind for the true self. Liberation comes from realizing you are the knower, not the known—the eternal witness beyond all change.
