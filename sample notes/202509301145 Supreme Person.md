In Chapter 15, Krishna reveals the concept of the Purushottama—the Supreme Person who transcends both the perishable material world and the imperishable soul.

There are two types of beings: the perishable (all material bodies) and the imperishable (the eternal souls). But beyond both is the Supreme Person, who enters the three worlds and maintains them.

This is the ultimate reality—not just the unchanging Brahman, but the personal Divine who is the source of both matter and spirit.
