# The Three Gunas

The three fundamental qualities of nature that bind the soul to the material world:

**Sattva (Goodness)**: Illumination, knowledge, purity. Binds through attachment to happiness and knowledge.

**Rajas (Passion)**: Activity, desire, attachment. Binds through craving for pleasure and action.

**Tamas (Ignorance)**: Darkness, inertia, delusion. Binds through laziness, sleep, and negligence.

Krishna teaches that transcending these three modes leads to liberation.
