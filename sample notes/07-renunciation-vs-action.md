Arjuna asks Krishna: "Which is betterâ€”renunciation of action (sannyasa) or performance of action (karma yoga)?"

Krishna's answer is nuanced:

**True Renunciation**: Not abandoning action, but renouncing the fruits of action. Acting without attachment to results.

**Karma Yoga**: Performing one's duty as an offering to the Divine, without selfish desire.

Both paths lead to liberation, but Krishna recommends karma yoga as more practical and sustainable. The renunciate who still craves outcomes has not truly renounced, while the active person free from attachment has achieved real renunciation.

The key is not what you do, but the consciousness with which you do it.
