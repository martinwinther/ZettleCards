# The Eternal Soul (Atman)

Krishna reveals to Arjuna that the soul is eternal, indestructible, and beyond birth and death.

"The soul is never born, nor does it ever die. Having come into being once, it never ceases to be. It is unborn, eternal, ever-existing, and primeval."

Just as a person discards worn-out clothes and puts on new ones, the soul discards worn-out bodies and enters new ones.

Weapons cannot cut it, fire cannot burn it, water cannot wet it, wind cannot dry it.

Understanding this truth removes the fear of death and the illusion of material existence.
