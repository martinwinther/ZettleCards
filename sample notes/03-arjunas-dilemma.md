# Arjuna's Dilemma on the Battlefield

At the start of the Gita, Arjuna faces a moral crisis on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. Seeing his relatives, teachers, and friends arrayed against him, he becomes overwhelmed with compassion and confusion.

He asks Krishna: "How can I fight against those I love? What good is a kingdom bought with the blood of my own family?"

This moment of despair becomes the catalyst for Krishna's profound teachings on duty, the nature of the self, and the paths to liberation.
